# FlappyBird
This is my first project and i learned many skills of game development through the project such as simulating physic in 2D, looping the object to make the game more challenge

But currently, i am reworking this project to improve the quality. Change the graphic, remake the code-flow and develop further feature which is spawning enemy or boss fight.
